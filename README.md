# QuizBomb
QuizBomb is a wacky website mainly for cold-blooded teachers or instructors. Anyone can create a multiple-choice quiz with up to four choices for each question. To take a quiz, have a student type in your quiz's ID on the Attempt page.

I created QuizBomb September 7-8, 2015, as a halfway hackathon project during Hack Reactor's Remote Prep course.

I used the *Solid* Bootstrap theme by Black Tie at [blacktie.co](http://blacktie.co).
